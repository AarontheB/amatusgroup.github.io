  REVISION started as an interdisciplinary summit in 2018 and evolved into a research lab working at the intersection of emerging technologies, successful futures, and technology-induced unintended consequences.

  Our mission is to shift innovation culture from opportunistic to responsible through raising risk-awareness and establishing accountability for the social, economic and environmental impact of emerging technologies.
