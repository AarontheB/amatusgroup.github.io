description_outer: Impact accelerator program
description_inner: "The purpose of your business manifests itself in a high degree
  of social and digital innovation, whose profits are reinvested in order to achieve
  this social goal and whose organisational structure or ownership reflects this goal.
  \n\nYou achieve this through the use of emerging technologies, such as blockchain
  or artificial intelligence, in the service of mankind. Your ambition transcends
  borders, with the potential to scale internationally, potentially globally.\n\nIn
  order to define solutions for the problems described above, the Company Builder
  amatus and the Blockchain Lab of the Gesellschaft f√ºr internationale Zusammenarbeit
  (GIZ) have agreed to establish the decentralised \"Because-Combinator\" programme
  for Impact entrepreneurs. \n \nTherefore, the winning start-ups move to Berlin mid
  January 2019 for 2-3 months, where they work at the partners offices intensively
  with the network of experts to bring the company into the best possible shape and
  refine their pitch to investors. The aim is the targeted identification and implementation
  of open points within the start-up or in product development or market implementation.
  To begin with, the startup will spend time at amatus where it is subject to a thorough
  inventory. \n\nTogether we sharpen the understanding of your problem and your solution
  offered. We link you with other Berlin based companies from different industries
  and thus build up expertise from the ecosystem such as Blockchain in order to give
  impact founders from all over the world a structure in their ideas and concepts
  as quickly as possible in the early-stage phase. This results in a significant sub-target
  (e.g. \"pitch ready\" status). Each of the two annual batches ends in a demo day
  during which the start-ups present their companies to a carefully selected audience
  (e.g. high level investors)."

  non-profit goal is the purpose of your business. '
